    "## Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The programming assignments are organized into sequences of short problems. You can see the structure of the programming assignment by opening the \"Table of Contents\" along the left side of the notebook (if you are using Google Colab or Jupyter Lab).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The problems are preceded by \"Description\" sections that explain relevant background. Before attempting any of the problems, make sure to read these \"Description\" sections and run all code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After reading the \"Description\" sections, proceed to the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each problem contains a blank cell containing the following comment: `# ENTER YOUR CODE IN THIS CELL`. Enter your code in these cells below the comment, being sure to not erase the comment. There are usually directions on the precise syntax that you will use to enter your solution properly. Please pay very careful attention to these directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Below most of the solution cells are \"autograder\" cells. Do not alter the autograder cells in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Do not add any cells of your own to the notebook, or delete any existing cells (either code or markdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **If you alter the notebook in any fashion so that the autograder fails to execute, your grade will be reduced accordingly.**"

    "1. Once you have finished entering all your solutions, you will want to rerun all cells from scratch to ensure that everything works OK. To do this in Google Colab, click \"Runtime -> Restart and run all\" along the top of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now scroll back through your notebook and make sure that all code cells ran properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If everything looks OK, save your assignment and upload the `.ipynb` file at the provided link on the course <a href=\"https://github.com/jmyers7/stats-book-materials\">GitHub repo</a>. Late submissions are not accepted.\n",

Because five letters is apparently more typing than a person could be expected to do, the Python community has universally agreed that the NumPy library should have the two-letter alias `np`. So, any time that we want to access the NumPy library in our code, we can type `np` instead of `numpy`."

Therefore, the array `y_val` contains 50 numbers.\n",

The parameter `figsize` is self-explanatory, and sets the size of the figure. It's often difficult to know a good size ahead of time, and you just need to tinker with these values.\n",

    "2. The call to `plt.subplots` returns _two_ items which are saved as `fig` and `axes`. We won't use `fig`, so don't worry about it. The `axes` object is actually a NumPy array that contains the two separate \"axes\" on which we will draw our plots.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. We then call the `plot` method on the second set of axes, `axes[1]`. We plot our cosine curve.\n",

    "Make sure that you label the $x$- and $y$-axes as shown, and also include the legends. I did **not** show you how to change the labels on `axes` objects, nor did I show you how to add legends to subplots. So this problem will be a bit of a challenge, as you'll need to figure that stuff out on your own.\n",
